### Now begins the graded problems.

# [PROBLEM 1] 
    # Fill in the definition of the class Post to hold information about one post that you've made on Facebook.
    # Add to the __init__ method additional code to set the instance variables comments and likes. 
    # More instructions about that follow, in the code below.
    # You need to pull out the appropriate data from the json representation of a single post. 
    # You can find a sample in the file samplepost.txt. 
    # There are tests that check whether you've pulled out the right data.
    
class Post():
    """object representing status update"""
    def __init__(self, post_dict={}):
        if 'message' in post_dict:
            self.message = post_dict['message']
        else:
            self.message = ""
        # if the post dictionary has a 'comments' key, set an instance variable self.comments
        # to the list of comment dictionaries you extract from post_dict. 
        # Otherwise, set self.comments to be an empty list: []

        # Something similar has already been done for the contents (message) of the original post, 
        # which is the value of the 'message' key in the dictionary, when it is present 
        # (photo posts don't have a message). See above for that code, which you can model the rest after!

        # But, pulling out the list of dictionaries from a post_dict
        # where each dictionary represents a comment from a post_dict 
        # is a little harder. You have to go one level deeper in the data structure 
        # Take a look at the sample of what a post_dict looks like
        # in the file samplepost.txt to figure out where to find information.
        
        # Now, similarly, if the post dictionary has a 'likes' key, set self.likes to
        # the list of likes dictionaries from the corresponding likes dictionary.  
        # Otherwise, if there are no 'likes', set self.likes to an empty list: []

    # [PROBLEM 2] In the Post class, fill in three methods:
    # -- positive() returns the number of words in the message that are in the list of positive words pos_ws (provided in our code)
    # -- negative() returns the number of words in the message taht are in the list of negative words neg_ws (provided in our code)
    # -- emo_score returns the difference between positive and negative scores
    # The beginnings of these functions are below -- fill in the rest of the method code!
    # There are tests of these methods later on.
        
    def positive(self):
#try using accumulaiton and a for loop to iterate through the message.
        return None
#Try using accumulation into an empty list and a for loop to iterate thorugh the message.                   
    def negative(self):
        return None

    def emo_score(self):
        return None
        

# [PROBLEM 3] Comment these lines of code with what is happening in them.
sample = open('samplepost.txt').read()
sample_post_dict = json.loads(sample)
p = Post(sample_post_dict)

# use the next lines of code if you're having trouble getting the tests to pass.
# they will help you understand what a post_dict contains, and what
# your code has actually extracted from it and assigned to the comments 
# and likes instance variables.
#print pretty(sample_post_dict)
#print pretty(p.comments)
#print pretty(p.likes)

# Here are tests for instance variables
print "-----PROBLEM 1 tests"
try:
    test.testEqual(type(p.comments), type([]))
    test.testEqual(len(p.comments), 4)
    test.testEqual(type(p.comments[0]), type({}))
    test.testEqual(type(p.likes), type([]))
    test.testEqual(len(p.likes), 4)
    test.testEqual(type(p.likes[0]), type({}))
except:
    print "One or more of the test invocations is causing an error,\nprobably because p.comments or p.likes has no elements..."

# Here are some tests of the positive, negative, and emo_score methods.
print "-----PROBLEM 2 tests"
p.message = "adaptive acumen abuses acerbic aches for everyone" # this line is to use for the tests, do not change it
test.testEqual(p.positive(), 2)
test.testEqual(p.negative(), 3)
test.testEqual(p.emo_score(), -1)        
    
# [PROBLEM 4] (SOLUTION PROVIDED, Just need to un-comment)
# Get a json-formatted version of your last 100 posts on Facebook. 
# (Hint: use the facebook module, as presented in class, and use https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer 
# to get your access token. 
# Every couple hours you will need to get a new token.)
# This is almost the same as the Facebook code example you saw in class.

# uncomment the next three lines, filling in your access token
# https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer here is a link to the facebook access token
# access_token = ""
# graph = facebook.GraphAPI(access_token)
# feed = graph.get_object("me/feed", limit = 100)

## If you do not have a facebook account with any feed posts,
## you can use our group: replace the "me" with this id string: "1196007610428928"

# [PROBLEM 5]
# For each of those posts in the feed you get back,
    # -- create an instance of your class Post.
    # This should fill in attributes for:
        #-- the message if it exists
        #-- the comments data if it exists
        #-- the likes data if it exists
    # Save all the post instances in a list called post_insts.
    # If you passed the tests above, all this should work if you create one instance per post correctly.
    # (Hint: think about the classes exercise you looked at in section last week)
    
try:
    print "testing whether the list post_insts exists and is the right kind of thing"
    test.testEqual(type(post_insts), type([]))
    test.testEqual(len(post_insts) > 0, True)
    test.testEqual(type(post_insts[0]),type(Post()))
except:
    print "failed tests for problem 5 or there is another error"


# [PROBLEM 6] 
# Write code to compute the top three likers and commenters on your posts overall. In separate lists: one for likers and one for commenters. 
# (the people who did the most comments and likes on all of your facebook posts)
# Hint: making dictionaries and sorting may both be useful here!

  
# [PROBLEM 7] 
# Write code to find out: were there more unique commenters or likers? 
# (Each person only gets counted once among commenters and once among likers.)
#    (Note that this is not the same as looking at whether there were more comments or likes!)
# Show your code work here!
  
# [PROBLEM 8] 
# Output a .csv file that lets you make scatterplots showing 
# net positivity on x-axis and comment-counts and like-counts on the y-axis. 
# Each row should represent one post and have: emo score, comment counts, and like counts.

#Use a for loop and interpolation
for x in post_insts:

#Output a .csv file to make three columns (emo_score, comment_counts, and like_counts)
#Then use excel to make scatterplots.
#One scatterplot is of comment_counts, another is of like_counts.

# You can see what the scatterplot might look
# like in emo_scores.xlsx. (In the example case, there's not an obvious
# correlation between positivity and how many comments or likes. There may not be,
# but you find that out by exploring the data!)

# Can you see any trend in whether your friends are more likely 
# to respond to positive vs. negative posts? That question is not graded, but something to think about.
# Post a screenshot of your scatterplot to the facebook group!
